# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      
      
      #- uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      #- name: Run a one-line script
      #  run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell

My work blends deep‑learning expertise with production‑grade engineering: I design and maintain CI-CD/ML‑Ops pipelines on OpenShift, orchestrate large‑scale training and fine‑tuning of LLMs and embedding models, and build agentic systems that interact with those models to accelerate scientific discovery. Leveraging a solid foundation in distributed systems, I translate complex research requirements into reliable, scalable solutions that empower scientists and domain experts to extract insights faster and more effectively.
